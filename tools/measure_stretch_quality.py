"""Score the time-stretch, so tuning it is not done by ear and argument.

    python tools/measure_stretch_quality.py <audio file> [rate]

Two numbers, both reference-free so they work on real music:

- **splice ratio** -- the largest sample-to-sample jump in the output over the
  largest one in the source. A time-stretch can only ever rearrange existing
  audio, so it cannot legitimately produce a steeper edge than the source
  contains: anything above 1.0 is a discontinuity the splice invented, which is
  what a click is. This is the number that tracks "harsh".
- **warble** -- on a constant-amplitude sine, how much the output envelope
  moves. Splices that land out of phase cancel, and the dip is heard as
  warbling rather than as a click, so a click detector alone misses it. Ideal
  is 0.

Plus the realtime factor, because every quality lever here costs CPU and the
budget is one core minus whatever the editor needs to paint.
