"""Where does the WSOLA splice search actually land, on real music?

    python tools/measure_search_bias.py <audio file> [audio file ...] [rate ...]

`grain_offset_ms` corrects for two things: the sawtooth from emitting a whole
grain of unstretched source (`SEQUENCE_FRAMES * (1 - rate)`, a real centring
problem with an exact answer), and the forward displacement the splice search
adds on top of that (`SEARCH_FRAMES`, one candidate of many in `[low, high)`).
The second term was never measured -- it assumed the search lands uniformly in
its reach and used half of it. This is that measurement.

**Black-box, no production code touched.** `_produce` does not expose
`best_offset` directly, but it does expose `_tail_mono`, and that is an exact
copy of `mono[best_offset + sequence : best_offset + grain_len]` -- a
110-frame (`OVERLAP_FRAMES`) slice of real audio, copied verbatim. Real audio
does not repeat itself byte-for-byte at that length by chance, so searching
for that exact slice within `mono[low + sequence : high + grain_len]` recovers
`best_offset` exactly, from outside the class, the same way
`test_the_search_is_forward_only_and_the_reference_width` already reads
`self._read` from outside it.

Reports the displacement (`best_offset - low`) as a fraction of `SEARCH_FRAMES`
per track per rate, because that fraction is what the formula needs -- and
whether it holds steady across rate and across tracks, because a number this
measurement fits to one track is exactly how the "half" it is replacing became
wrong in the first place.
