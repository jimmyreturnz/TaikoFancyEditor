"""What dragging a green line's SV vertically actually costs, per mouse-move.

    python tools/measure_sv_drag.py [point_count] [note_count]

Built for one specific report: dragging a green line up/down feels laggy, and
the SV value changes at 8 decimal places (`SV_DECIMALS`) while it moves.
Measures whether the decimal precision itself is the cost, or whether it is
`_edit_sv_point` -> `_refresh_difficulty_sv_views` running in full on *every*
mouse-move event -- which nothing used to skip even when the new value was the
same as the old one, and at 8 decimals of float precision it almost never was.

Generates a synthetic gimmick-sized map (many green lines, many notes) rather
than needing a real one on disk: the question is about the cost of the
refresh pipeline over N objects, which is the same whichever objects they are.

This measures the per-call cost, which is what tells you *whether cutting the
call count is worth doing at all* -- 17ms against a mouse that can deliver a
move every few ms is the actual lag. It does not exercise the fix itself
(`SVEditorView.mouseMoveEvent` quantizing to `SV_DRAG_STEP` and skipping an
unchanged value): that is cheap, in-process signal-emission logic with no
audio device or paint cost of its own, and is covered directly by
`tests/test_sv_editor.py`'s `test_a_drag_quantizes_to_the_step_and_skips_unchanged_moves`.
Both calls below still go through `_edit_sv_point` directly and so both cost
about the same per call -- what the fix changes is how many of these 3000-point,
~17ms calls a real drag actually makes, not what any one of them costs.
