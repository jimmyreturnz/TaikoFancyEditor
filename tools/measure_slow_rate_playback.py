"""What *sustained* slow-rate playback delivers to the device, continuously,
as opposed to `measure_rate_change.py` (a one-time rate change) or
`bench_timestretch.py` (a standalone re-implementation with different grain
sizes than `TimeStretcher`'s real `SEQUENCE_FRAMES`/`OVERLAP_FRAMES`/
`SEARCH_FRAMES` -- so it measures a different amount of work per second of
output than the real code, and cannot answer this question by itself).

    python tools/measure_slow_rate_playback.py [audio file] [rate] [seconds]

Built for report #2: "the speed is ok but the stuttering really affects the
quality" at slower-than-1.0x. Plays continuously at `rate` (default 0.5) with
no seeks, and taps `_device.write()` and `_Engine._fill()` directly on the
real production classes -- the same technique `measure_seek.py` uses -- to
answer three separable questions rather than assuming one:

  1. Does output fall behind wall-clock (an underrun -- WSOLA or the decoder
     not producing fast enough)?
  2. Are there gaps between writes bigger than the pump interval (the device
     starved for one tick or more)?
  3. Is any single `_fill()` call itself slow enough to blow the 10ms pump
     budget (the search costing more than the budget on this machine)?

No audio file lying around is fine: like `measure_seek.py`, the question here
is about the pipeline's timing, not what the file happens to sound like, so a
generated tone is reused if none is given.
