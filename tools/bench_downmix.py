"""How long the track's mono downmix holds the GIL, old against new.

`downmix_to_mono` runs on the audio engine's thread for every decoded buffer,
right after a map opens. It used to be a Python generator over every stereo
frame; with the GIL handed over only every `sys.getswitchinterval()` (5ms),
that was the UI thread stalling in 5ms slices for the whole decode -- a third
of all frames over budget for the first second or so after every load.

Checks the two produce identical samples before timing anything: the mono
buffer is the WSOLA splice search's input, so a different number there is a
different sound, and "faster" means nothing if it is not also "the same".

Usage: python tools/bench_downmix.py [seconds of stereo audio, default 131]
