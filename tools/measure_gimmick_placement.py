"""Measure the latency of one gimmick placement: fake slider layer, regular and shiny.

    python tools/measure_gimmick_placement.py [--profile]

Written against the report "placing fake sliders or shiny lags" per CLAUDE.md's
measure-first rule. Only times `MainWindow._place_gimmick`; nothing in gui.py
or gimmick_session.py is changed.

No real dense gimmick map was available to run this against -- there are no
.osu files checked into the repo (tests build fixtures from byte literals in
tests/osu_fixtures.py) and this machine has no osu! Songs folder. The "dense"
document below is synthesized instead: it copies the *shape* CLAUDE.md
documents for a real gimmick map (an anti-barline wall is one uninherited
point roughly every beat/anti_lines_per_beat ms; a hidden anti-barline sheet
adds a green line for every note) rather than random data, but it is still
synthetic. If a real dense map turns up, re-run this against it before trusting
these numbers over that harness's own.

Times two things per kind ("regular", "shiny"):
  1. the whole `_place_gimmick` call, on a light document and then on one
     carrying ~40k timing points and ~15k hit objects, to see whether cost
     scales with existing gimmick density;
  2. the same placement broken into its phases -- structure build
     (`_gimmick_commands`), the undo push (`CompositeCommand.apply`),
     `_refresh_difficulty_views`, `_refresh_difficulty_sv_views`, and the
     repaint each schedules (`app.processEvents()`) -- by replicating
     `_place_gimmick`'s own body with a stopwatch between each call rather
     than by modifying it.

With --profile, also runs cProfile over one dense placement of each kind and
prints the cumulative-time hot list, the way tools/profile_playback.py does.
