"""What wheel-scrolling during playback does to the frames and the playhead.

    python tools/measure_wheel_seek.py <map.osu> [notch_interval_ms ...] [--seconds S]

Plays the map for real (real `TrackPlayer`, real frame timer, real event loop)
and posts mouse-wheel notches at the main timeline every `notch_interval_ms`,
forward only. Per interval, plus a no-wheel baseline, it reports:

- **frames**: the gap between rendered frames (p50/p95/max) and how many
  exceeded 1.5x the 8.33ms cadence, i.e. a dropped frame; and the work inside
  `_render_gameplay_frame` itself.
- **backward**: how often the position broadcast to the views went *down*.
  Every notch moves forward, so any backward step is the playhead snapping
  back to a stale audio report -- the "jumps" half of the report.
- **seek_audio**: what one notch costs synchronously in the wheel handler.

Runs on the real platform with the window kept off-screen
(`WA_DontShowOnScreen`): the offscreen plugin delivers no paint events, so a
run there measures no painting at all (see `tools/check_view_refresh.py`).
Sized 1920x1080 for the same reason `profile_playback.py` is.
