"""How far the music's attack sits from each note's millisecond, per map.

    python tools/measure_note_vs_music.py <map.osu> [map.osu ...]
    python tools/measure_note_vs_music.py --selftest

The slow-rate "hitsound lands before the kick" report was a constant song-time
offset, not the stretch: inaudible at 1.0x and four times longer in wall time
at 0.25x. This measures it where the stretch cannot be involved -- straight off
the decoded source, exactly as `QAudioDecoder` hands it to the engine -- so the
number is the gap between where the chart says a hit is and where this app's
decode of the song puts it.

Mappers time notes to the attack as osu! plays it, so across a whole
difficulty the median gap is the decode's disagreement with osu!, plus this
detector's own bias. The bias is the same for every file, which is why the
number to read is **MP3 against OGG**, and why `--selftest` has to read about
zero on a source whose attacks are known before any real map is believed.

For MP3s it also prints the LAME tag's encoder delay, the gapless-playback
field one decoder honours and another may not.
