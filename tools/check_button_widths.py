"""Every button whose own label does not fit inside it.

    python tools/check_button_widths.py [--dialogs] [--gimmick <a real .osu>]

"The pink buttons eat their own text" has been diagnosed by eye several times
and fixed by nudging numbers. This asks the question the way Qt answers it:
for each QPushButton, what does its label cost in the font the button is
*actually painted in*, plus the padding and border its own style charges, and
is the button that wide?

Both halves have to be read after `ensurePolished()`. Before that a button
reports the application font and no stylesheet padding at all, which is the
trap every previous round of this fell into -- the width was pinned from a
measurement taken before the style that decides it had been applied.

--dialogs also opens the dialogs, which is where most of the pink buttons are;
without it only the main window's own chrome is walked.
