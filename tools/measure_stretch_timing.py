"""Does a transient come out where the playhead says it does?

    python tools/measure_stretch_timing.py [rate ...]

The question `measure_stretch_quality.py` cannot answer. That one scores what
the stretch *sounds* like; this one scores whether the song time the engine
reports is the song time you are hearing, which is the whole reason an editor
slows down at all.

Built because three throwaway probes of this disagreed with each other during
one investigation -- exactly the trap CLAUDE.md warns about -- so the number
lives in a harness now instead of being re-derived each time.

**A click train, not a tone.** On a sine many splice offsets are equally
correct, so the error hides inside content that is identical either way and the
stretch scores well no matter how far off it is. An impulse is somewhere or it
is not.

Two numbers per rate, and the *signed* one is the one that matters:

- **signed** -- the bias. A one-sided error is a constant lag between the audio
  and the cursor, which is what a mapper hears as "the playhead is lying".
  Should sit near zero.
- **absolute** -- the spread that is left once the bias is gone. Bounded below
  by the stretch itself: inside one grain the audio advances at 1.0x while the
  playhead advances at `rate`, so `SEQUENCE_FRAMES * (1 - rate)` of slew is
  real and cannot be reported away, only centred. Shortening the grain is
  therefore the only lever on it, which is what `SEQUENCE_MS` is about.

Measured baselines, 0.25 / 0.5 / 0.75 / 1.0, absolute error:

- before any of this:            40.8 / 32.1 / 20.3 / 0.00 ms
- after centring on the grain:   15.8 /  5.1 /  5.8 / 0.00 ms
- at SoundTouch's 117ms grain:   21.2 / 15.0 /  5.4 / 0.00 ms
- at the 20ms grain shipped now:  7.7 /  2.9 /  1.7 / 0.00 ms

**Careful with `absolute` on this signal.** At the 20ms grain `worst` comes
out barely above `absolute` (7.92 against 7.66 at 0.25x), which would mean the
sawtooth has no spread at all -- and it must have 15ms of it there. The likely
reason is that WSOLA's search aligns transients, so a train of impulses gets
every click snapped to the same phase of its grain. Read a small spread here as
the bias being small, not as the spread being gone.

And the column that this harness was missing when it mattered:

- **snaps** -- ticks where the reported position moves so far from a smooth
  advance that gui.py's interpolating clock gives up and jumps to it. The
  timing columns above are blind to this: a correction can place every
  transient perfectly and still arrive as a step at each grain boundary, which
  on screen is the playhead teleporting a dozen times a second. It measured
  146 snaps in 1199 ticks at 0.25x while the timing columns read 2.0ms, and
  the report was "it teleports like hell". **Must be 0.**

1.0x must always read exactly 0.00: `_produce` takes a straight-copy path there
with no grain and no search, so anything else means the correction has leaked
into the one rate that never needed it.
