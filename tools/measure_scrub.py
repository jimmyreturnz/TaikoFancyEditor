"""What a timeline *drag* (not a single click) does -- repeated seeks in a
burst, the way `mouseMoveEvent` in gui.py fires `seek_requested` on every
move while the button is held (gui.py ~2434-2437, 3992, 5380/5470), each of
which reaches `TrackPlayer.setPosition` -> `_Engine.seek`.

    python tools/measure_scrub.py [audio file] [n_seeks] [interval_ms] [seconds]

`measure_seek.py` already showed a *single* seek's sink-restart costs about
10-40ms and is mostly harmless once landed (the position freeze it reports
turns out to be 5ms-poll-vs-10ms-pump aliasing, not a real stall -- see
`tools/measure_position_baseline.py`... except that harness lives in the
session scratchpad, not tracked; the number was 348ms/695ms frozen with NO
seek at all, against 421ms/700ms around a seek, which is the same thing
within noise). What a *single* seek does not cover is a drag: N seeks fired
faster than `_open_sink()`'s own ~10ms lands, back to back, each tearing the
sink down and rebuilding it. This taps `_device.write()` the same way
`measure_seek.py` does, across the whole burst, and reports the total silent
wall time in it -- which is what a scrub actually sounds like, as opposed to
what one click sounds like.
