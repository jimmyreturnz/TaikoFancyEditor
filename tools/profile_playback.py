"""Measure the cost of one playback frame, the way stutter is actually caused.

    python tools/profile_playback.py <a real .osu> [frames] [--gimmick]
                                     [--gameplay] [--skin NAME] [--profile]
                                     [--at MS] [--playing RATE] [--view-opacity N]
                                     [--focused] [--no-motion]

--playing plays the song for real at RATE and reports the gaps between the
app's own rendered frames instead of timing synthetic ones.

--at starts the run at a millisecond rather than at the first hit object. A
gimmick is a *section* of a map, and the first note is almost never in it.

The editor renders at 120fps, so every frame has an 8.33ms budget: the clock
advance, the hitsound scan, and a synchronous repaint of every open view. A
frame that overruns is a dropped frame, and dropped frames are the stutter.

Reports the distribution rather than the mean -- stutter is the tail. With
--profile it also prints the cumulative-time hot list for the same run.
