"""Play a real difficulty with its notes, through the real device.

    python tools/play_with_hitsounds.py <map.osu> [rate] [seconds] [start_ms]

The end-to-end check no unit test can make. `test_hitsound_mixing.py` proves a
note lands on the output sample its music does; this proves the whole path --
parse, schedule, decode, stretch, mix, sink -- puts a hearable note on a
hearable drum, at a rate where being a few milliseconds out is audible.

It also reports what the mixer actually did, because "I heard notes" and "every
note sounded once" are different claims:

- **voiced** -- how many times the mixer started a sample. Counted by watching
  the voice list get appended to, not by diffing its length, which cancels out
  when one voice finishes in the same grain another starts.
- **offered** -- distinct notes whose source frame the mixer was handed at
  least once. **These two must be equal.** Fewer voiced means notes were
  dropped; more means the dedupe leaked, and at 0.25x a leak plays every note
  four times 5ms apart, which is a flam rather than a hit.

Read the source span, not the wall clock: at 0.25x ten seconds of playback is
two and a half seconds of song, so a sparse intro legitimately yields two
notes.
