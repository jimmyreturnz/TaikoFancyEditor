"""What a seek during playback actually costs -- wall-clock and the position trace.

    python tools/measure_seek.py [audio file] [seek_to_ms] [seconds]

`audio file` is optional -- omit it (or pass just the numbers) to fall back to
a generated tone; see the note at the bottom of this docstring for why that is
fine here.

Built for one specific report: clicking the timeline bar while a song is
playing makes playback stutter once. `_Engine.seek` in audio_engine.py tears
the QAudioSink down and rebuilds it while playing -- its own docstring says
why: the sink is holding up to SINK_BUFFER_MS of the *old* position with no
way to discard it but a restart. This measures what that restart actually
costs: how long `_open_sink()` (QAudioSink() + .start(), on the audio thread)
takes while the seek sits waiting on it, and whether the song-position trace
shows a stall or jump big enough to be an audible click rather than a smooth
handoff.

No audio file lying around handy is fine here: unlike `measure_audio_backend`
(which cares about codec-dependent decode chunking) this is asking about the
sink restart itself, which does not care what produced the PCM -- so this
generates a short sine-wave WAV next to this script on first run.
