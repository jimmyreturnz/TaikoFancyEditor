"""App colour themes, as a recolouring of the one palette the code is written in.

Every colour in the UI is a literal in the default (pink) theme -- some 300 of
them, across sixty stylesheets and the paint code. A theme is therefore not a
second set of literals but a map from those to its own colours, applied at the
two places a colour reaches Qt from Python:

- every `setStyleSheet` call, by wrapping `QWidget.setStyleSheet` and
  `QApplication.setStyleSheet` once (`install`);
- paint code, through `color()` instead of `QColor("#...")`.

So a new widget written in the pink literals is themed for free, and the pink
theme is the code exactly as written: `install` does nothing for it.

A theme changes live (`switch`, owner 2026-10-08: no restart). The wrapper
keeps each sheet as it was written (the `themeSource` property), so a switch
re-translates every sheet from that rather than from the last theme's output;
paint code reads `color()` as it paints. The few things that compute a colour
once and keep it -- a sheet built from a mixed colour, a cached layer -- are
the window's to redo after a switch (`MainWindow.retheme`).

What a theme leaves alone, deliberately: the note colours (don, kat,
drumroll), osu!'s snap tick colours, the SV layer's green, star-rating colours
and the red of destructive actions. Those mean something in the chart, not
in the chrome, and none of them is a key below.
