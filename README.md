**An osu!taiko editor with a visual pattern arranger built in, now with gimmick editor**

*日本語版は [README_JP.md](README_JP.md) をご覧ください。*

Taiko Fancy Arranger started as a tool for turning osu!taiko notes into visual patterns — text, shapes, equations, drawings, spirals — without placing every circle by hand. Version 2.0.0 grew it into an editor: browse your osu! Songs folder, open a difficulty, edit notes, edit scroll velocity, preview the chart the way osu! renders it, and still arrange notes into patterns when you want to. Version 3.0.0 adds a dedicated gimmick editor, for the fake sliders, barline tricks and extreme-SV effects that osu!taiko mappers build out of timing points rather than notes. 

Everything stays a playable osu! beatmap. Sections the editor does not support editing storyboards, breaks, colours, editor bookmarks yet.

> **Current release:** v3.3.3  
> **Platform:** Windows x64  
> **Author:** [jimmyreturnz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11306153)

The main inspirations include Alchyr's ranked maps *13 Stairs* and *Helios*, which use unusual note placement to create visual expression. You should go check it out [here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1093671#taiko/3819326)

## What is new in 3.3.3

- Fixed a bug in Fancy Arranger where the position of notes reset after clicking 'Apply Transformation to ..." and then readjust some value and click again.
- **Pasted fake sliders keep their offset from the snap** instead of landing on the playhead, this will be very useful when copypasting them.
- **Placing a note on a heavy gimmick map is about 20% faster**
- **Meter** is editable in a red line's double-click dialog.
- **Anti-barline slits default to 1 tick for Don and 2 for Kat**, and the gimmick editor's chart default SV offset starts exactly on the note (offset 0).
Full notes: [`docs/releases/v3.3.3.md`](docs/releases/v3.3.3.md).

## To be added / fixed:
- Red line generator function with **preconfigured meter** (could be useful for 60000 bpm 1/4 meter static barlines gimmick.
- improving the smoothness when scrolling too fast, been actively trying to find solutions and improve it for a while now. It is much better than before, and there is still a room for an improvement.
- Will change barline note for don to default as only using redline at current bpm at +1 ms and not mirroring it to -1ms. 
- Will add more config to the barline gimmick layer (or fake slider layer too) to allow presetting "invisible note" bpm and "red line" bpm separately. By saying invisible note bpm, you already know that placing high bpm at the note's position make it invisible, and you then put other things like either fake slider notes at +2ms or barline gimmick there.
- Preventing regular note (don kat), green line, red line, from having more than one of each of them in the same millisecond\
Currently there might still be a bug where SV line is duplicated, so if you can notice that in some parts the SV looks weird (the main suspects are where there are many gimmick objects), please check timingpoints in osu editor itself to see if there is any duplicated line for now.
- Separate selection in fake slider layer.\
Right now when you drag selects, it selects both layers inside it at once, will separate them from each other (hold shift to select both layers at once)
- Sometimes copypasting objects in any layers might cause it to land in wrong millisecond (+- 1 or 2 milliseconds), this problem also happens in osu editor as well.\
Within the editor, I will be ensuring that it get pasted exactly on where the snap is down to the millisecond on all objects and layer.
- Might as well add auto snapping function that detects the object's nearest snaps first then snap to it, unlike osu stable auto snapper that currently snap notes to your current snaps.
- Will add an option to place redline at the first fake slider at the current BPM (or custom BPM) to accommodate the behavior of you wanting the regular note to be invisible with high bpm, and reset the chart speed back to normal with current bpm at one millisecond later.
- Will also try to come up with a way that you can make barline kat or fake slider kat to have different approaching behavior (like adding an increasing SV speed to barline kat to make them look harder to read). 
- UI rework and adding proper assets to the app.
- Further optimization when applicable.

Full development log detail lives in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).

## Windows SmartScreen notice

Taiko Fancy Arranger v3.3.3 is a currently unsigned Windows application. The release includes source-level security hardening, input validation, safer file handling, automated tests, and published SHA-256 checksums.

Windows Defender SmartScreen may still display an "unrecognized app" warning because the executable has not yet established download reputation.

---

## Languages

Currently supports English and Japanese. There is no Thai translation yet even though I am Thai myself 😂

Language is chosen on first start and can be changed in **Settings**. Changing it asks you to restart, because Qt does not retranslate widgets that already exist.

---

## Download and run

1. Open the repository's **Releases** page.
2. Download:

```text
TaikoFancyArranger-Windows-x64.zip
```

3. Extract the entire ZIP.
4. Run:

```text
TaikoFancyArranger.exe
```

5. If update exists, upon opening the program, there will be a patch note alongside with an option to download the new version.
Python and PySide6 are bundled with the portable Windows release. Players using the release ZIP do not need to install Python or run `pip`.

> Windows may show a reputation warning for an unsigned new application. Review the repository and release files before running the program.

---

## First start

1. **Choose a language.** English or 日本語.
2. **Choose your osu! Songs folder.** Pre-filled with `%LOCALAPPDATA%/osu!/Songs` when it exists. The folder is remembered, and can be changed later from the library page.
3. **Wait for the scan.** The first scan reads every `.osu` file once and takes a while on a large collection. It runs in slices, so the window stays responsive. Later starts show the cached list before verifying it. You may use the app while it is scanning, but the experience will not be that smooth on the editor and osu. Thus, it is suggested to wait for the scan, or make a small folder that consists of only maps that you would want to edit.

Cancelling the folder picker leaves the library empty with a **Change folder** button.

---

## Song library

The library page is the front door.

- Left: songs, shown as `Artist - Title · mapper · difficulty count`.
- Right: the difficulties of the selected song.
- Double-click a difficulty, or press **Edit this difficulty**, to open it in the editor.

Controls:

- **Search** — matches artist, title, both Unicode variants, difficulty name, creator and tags at once. Same behavior as osu!
- **Group by** — nothing, mapper, or artist.
- **Sort** — A→Z or Z→A, which reverses group order too.
- **Original language metadata** — shows `ArtistUnicode`/`TitleUnicode` instead of the romanized fields, falling back to whichever the map actually has.

Only taiko charts are listed.

There will be a rework on the song library soon, stay tuned!

---

## Editor page

The Editor page stacks views vertically, grouped under their difficulty. Open one with **+** (view type + difficulty). Opening a difficulty automatically gives it a chart view and an SV view.

Holding **Ctrl** places at 1ms precision regardless of the snap divisor, with a guide line and a live millisecond readout in the corner of every view.

View types:

| View | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Chart | Notes on a time axis, with a snap grid |
| SV editor | Red, green and yellow timing lines plus an effective-SV graph |
| Gameplay viewer | Read-only osu!taiko gameplay preview |
| Density | The white-to-yellow note density heatmap |

You can edit multiple difficulties at the same time as well, but I believe you still have to save each of them in each view.
The very next update will come with Ctrl+Shift+s to save all difficulties at once, and will separate list of possible 'open view' between regular editor and gimmick editor.

### Note editing

The tool row sits at the bottom of the page and acts on the focused chart view.

```text
1  Select
2  Don
3  Kat
4  Slider
5  Spinner
6  New combo
```

- Left click places at the snapped time; a translucent ghost previews where it lands.
- Sliders and spinners are **click-dragged** to their length. Press near the right edge of an existing one to resize it, or drag its tail with the **Select** tool afterwards.
- Holding **Shift** will changes the note to finisher size.
- Right click deletes the note under the cursor
- One object per millisecond, spinners excepted — placing over a note replaces it, as a single undo step.

### SV editing

With an SV view focused, the tool row becomes:

```text
1  Select
2  Green line
3  Function
```

- Red lines are uninherited (BPM) points, green are inherited (SV), yellow means both share a millisecond.
- Click a green line to select it; drag vertically to change its SV, horizontally to retime it, snapped to the grid. Which axis you get depends on how close the click was to the value dot.
- Deleting green lines will not remove Red lines
- Double-clicking any timing line allows you to toggle kiai or the line's omit-barline flag.
- The graph shows **effective** SV — green over red where both exist — with a fixed 0.1x floor and an autoscaling ceiling. - to be changed to 0.01x
Will fix vertical dragging increases SV by literally 8 decimal points later in the next update, it will be by 0.01 increment later.

**Function mode:** drag a range, then choose initial rate, final rate, position offset, whether to omit the first barline, and whether the sweep is relative to the final BPM. Seven curves are offered as tiles, each drawing the sweep you actually typed:

```text
linear   sin in   sin out   exp1.3   exp1.6   true exp   sin
```

Points are generated on the notes in range by default, or every N snaps. The default −5 ms offset makes sure the SV is already in force when the note it governs arrives. However many points it makes, it is one undo step.

Will eventually add an option to select exp(x>=1) SV for an experimental purpose.

### Editor shortcuts

```text
Space               Play or pause
Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y     Undo / redo (per difficulty)
Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V     Copy / paste notes or SV points, snapped on paste
Ctrl+S              Save every changed difficulty
Ctrl+A              Select all in the focused view
Delete              Delete the selection
Esc                 Back to the song list
1 - 6               Tools, routed to whichever tool row is showing
Mouse wheel         Seek by one snap
Shift+wheel         Seek by one beat
Ctrl+wheel          Zoom
Alt+wheel           Change beat snap
```

All of these are rebindable in **Settings**, except `Delete` and `Ctrl+A`, which belong to the focused view.

Leaving the editor with unsaved work lists which difficulties are unsaved by name and offers **Save**, **Continue without saving**, or **Cancel**. Continuing without saving keeps the edits in the session and nothing will be saved.

## Gimmick editor page

A "gimmick" in osu!taiko is a visual effect built out of timing points rather than notes: drumrolls of negative length that are drawn but never hittable ("fake sliders"), notes drawn out of barlines, and extreme BPM/SV values used to move objects around the screen.

The gimmick page stacks six layers over one difficulty: the normal chart, a fake slider layer, a barline gimmick layer, and an SV layer for each of the three.

Entering it for a difficulty asks once whether to edit that difficulty in place or copy it into a new `[Gimmick]` difficulty, and remembers the answer permanently.\
You can also change the timing reference for a smoother scrolling experience, it is suggested to use a clean version of the chart though.\

Kiai sections draw as a translucent orange band in every layer. Every timing point a gimmick tool generates carries the kiai state of the current section.

Holding Ctrl while hovering your cursor at any layer allows you to place objects as precise as 1 millisecond apart.

### Fake sliders and shiny notes

The fake slider layer places fake sliders, and "shiny" notes (several fake sliders stacked on one millisecond, which can be seen in game as a bright white glow beside a note)\
The tool classify them by position: a fake slider at one millisecond after the note or line it hangs off is a shiny, two milliseconds after is a fake slider.\
The layer draws them on two rows, fake sliders on the ceiling and shiny below, with the snap grid down the middle, because at gimmick zoom they sit one pixel column apart.\
I hope this design would be easier for you to tell which notes are fake sliders and which notes are shiny.

You can also change the length of the fake slider by double clicking it, defaulting to -0.0010.\
This is to allow you to kind of 'encode' the fake slider; let's say you have many fake sliders in any given interval and you want each of the groups within them to have different SV behavior, you may pre-config the length before you place the fake slider and then apply SV only to fake sliders with this specific length :) 

Tools:

```text
Fake Slider
Don / Kat
Shiny
Multiple Fake Slider
Function
Convert Notes
Kiai
```

- **Multiple Fake Slider** writes a whole run of fake sliders at a configured spacing in one click.
- **Function** fills a dragged range.
- **Convert Notes** turns the chart's own notes into fake slider or shiny structures.
- **Kiai** drags a range and turns every timing point inside it into one kiai section.

### Barline gimmicks

Notes drawn out of red lines — a Don is one mirrored pair of bars, a Kat is three, and each pair is independently configurable.\
Bars can be mirrored around the note or trail it. A red line tool has its own configurable BPM, and a Function tool fills a range with red lines on a millisecond count or the beat grid, with an optional BPM ramp and a chosen SV.\
You can also do the same kind of behavior with fake sliders where you might want to apply SV to this specific BPM, or better, BPM range.

### Per-structure SV

Each of the three object layers (chart, fake slider, barline) has its own SV layer, and each owns exactly its own structures' milliseconds\
Copy and paste inside them maps by object index rather than by millisecond, so an SV shape lifted off four fake sliders lands on the next four whatever their spacing. Oscillating SV joins the seven easing curves in the generator.\
You can also change the offset of where SV is applied if you prefer, however it is suggested in gimmick editor that you should apply it directly onto where the object you want to apply the SV to is.\
As mentioned earlier, you can also apply SV speed only to fake sliders with length-specific and barline with BPM-specific.\
I believe this can simplify your gimmick beatmaps creation workflow much better, especially if you are a big fan of barline gimmick with barline to obstruct players' reading.

### Known Issue (will fix soon)
- Will try to figure out an issue that when you add redline to the ms where there is already a fake slider and it would be moved to fake slider layer (this is fine and intended), but you cannot move them afterward.\
- You cannot place redline directly under fake sliders anyways, the current workaround is to place it at somewhere else and Ctrl+Drag it to the fake slider. 
I will add an option to place redline at the first fake slider at the current BPM (or custom BPM) to accommodate the behavior of you wanting the regular note to be invisible with high bpm, and reset the chart speed back to normal with current bpm at one millisecond later. I hope this would standardize the format of how gimmick charts should be created.

## Fancy Arranger page

The original visual arranger, unchanged in behaviour and now on its own page with its own timeline, timing bar, density chart, difficulty selector, AR/CS controls and export buttons.

### Transformations

- Text
- Drawing
- Mathematical Equation
- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Taiko
- Vertical Taiko
- Circle and ellipse
- Square, triangle, and diamond
- Star
- Spiral
- Infinity
- Arc
- Straight line
- Wave and zigzag
- Random
- Random Walk
- DVD Bouncing
- Pinwheel

Some transformations support chunking, direction controls, seeded randomness, or **Back and Forth** traversal.

Polyline and Bézier path exist in the transformation engine but are not yet selectable in the interface, because both need a way to enter control points that the parameter panel does not have yet. Freehand shapes are covered by **Drawing** in the meantime.

### Text patterns

Enter text such as:

```text
67
TAIKO
日本
ภาษาไทย
```

The Text transformation uses a selectable system font and fits the result inside the osu! playfield. Text size, margins, direction, note count, and position can be adjusted before applying the result.

Text notes are ordered from top to bottom, then horizontally within each visual row. Reverse direction keeps the top-to-bottom order and reverses only the horizontal order within each row.

You can also select fonts from your computer as well!

### Drawing patterns

Drawing accepts multiple independent strokes, treated as one visual shape rather than being connected into an artificial path. An image can be imported and traced into strokes.

Drawing notes are ordered:

1. From top to bottom
2. From left to right within each visual row

Reverse direction keeps the top-to-bottom order and changes each row to right-to-left.

Drawing-window shortcuts:

```text
Ctrl+Z    Undo the latest stroke
Ctrl+Y    Restore the latest undone stroke
```

### Mathematical equation patterns

> Warning: this is still an experimental feature, please expect some bugs.

Equation mode can generate note paths from graph outlines.

Supported modes:

- Explicit, for example `y=sin(x)`
- Implicit, for example `x^2+y^2=9`
- Parametric, for example `x(t)=cos(3*t)` and `y(t)=sin(2*t)`

Restrictions can be added to implicit or explicit expressions, for example:

```text
tan(x^2+y^2)=1{|x|<3}{|y|<3}
```

The built-in graph keyboard focuses on graph-related operations such as:

```text
sin  cos  tan
asin acos atan
sqrt abs
exp ln log
floor ceil
pi e
```

The equation renderer creates outlines only. It does not fill or color mathematical regions.

### Pinwheel patterns

Pinwheel creates a central burst with curved blades and optional seeded wander.

Its controls include:

- Inner circle
- Inner-circle note count and radius
- Number of blades
- Blade curl and spread
- Inner and outer radius
- Rotation
- Radius growth
- Wander strength and seed

### Arranger workflow

1. Drag across the timeline to select a section, or `Ctrl+A` for the whole map.
2. Choose **All Notes** or **Split Don / Kat**, then a transformation.
3. Adjust parameters, or drag the pattern directly inside the transformation view. In Split mode, dragging a Don moves the Don pattern and dragging a Kat moves the Kat pattern.
4. Press **Transform selected notes** to commit it to the session. `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` still apply.
5. Set **AR** and **CS** if needed — sliders from `0.00` to `10.00` in `0.01` steps, with a numeric field and pink `+` / `-` buttons (as on every spin box in the app now). `AR 0.00` is the slowest approach rate and `CS 0.00` the biggest circle size. Left alone, `ApproachRate:10` and `CircleSize:7` remain.
6. **Export applied map** writes a separate arranged difficulty. **Apply all changes to original file** overwrites the loaded `.osu`, after making a backup.

The transformation pane is a preview. Nothing is written until you export or apply.

The beatmap background is shown in the transformation view; its opacity is adjustable and another image can be dragged in to replace it.

## Saving and exporting

| Action | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Save | Global header | Writes every changed difficulty at once, backing each one up first |
| Export new difficulty | Global header | Writes a new difficulty file into the same song folder |
| Export applied map | Fancy Arranger | Writes an arranged difficulty to a destination you choose |
| Apply all changes to original file | Fancy Arranger | Overwrites the loaded `.osu`, after a backup |

Saving regenerates `[TimingPoints]` and `[HitObjects]` and passes every other section through unchanged. The only deliberate loss is `//` comments inside those two sections.

---

## Important mapper notes

### Always keep a backup

Although the program backs up before overwriting, keep a separate copy of important beatmaps before editing.

### Test the exported map in osu!

Always open the exported difficulty in the osu! editor and verify:

- Note positions and timing
- Timing points, SV and barlines
- Hitsounds
- Approach Rate and Circle Size
- Background and difficulty name

### Visual readability depends on note count

Text, equations, drawings, and detailed shapes need enough selected notes to remain recognizable. If a pattern looks incomplete, try:

- Selecting more notes
- Increasing the number of notes per pattern
- Reducing text complexity
- Reducing the number of Pinwheel blades
- Increasing equation resolution
- Adjusting graph bounds or size

### Known approximation

Slider length is computed with osu!'s default `SliderMultiplier` of 1.4, because this program does not yet parse the `[Difficulty]` section's own value. Slider *timing* is exact; only the stored length field can be slightly off on a map that overrides the multiplier.

## Building from source

```text
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
pyside6-lrelease translations/taiko_ja.ts
python -m unittest discover
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean TaikoFancyArranger.spec
```

Run from source with `python gui.py`, or `run_from_source.bat` on Windows.

Packaging files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VERSION` | The release version, bundled into the build |
| `TaikoFancyArranger.spec` | PyInstaller spec — bundles `assets/`, `VERSION` and the compiled `.qm` translations |
| `requirements.txt` | Runtime dependency (PySide6) |
| `requirements-build.txt` | The above plus PyInstaller |
| `.env.example` | Documents that **no** environment variables are needed; never put secrets here |
| `.github/workflows/release-windows.yml` | Builds the portable ZIP and SHA-256 checksums, and attaches them to a published release |

Publishing a GitHub release tagged `vX.Y.Z` runs that workflow, which compiles translations, builds, and uploads `TaikoFancyArranger-Windows-x64.zip` plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`. A matching `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` is bundled into the ZIP when present.

The program reads no environment variables and needs no `.env` file. `.env` and key/certificate files are gitignored.

Tests run headless:

```text
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m unittest discover -v
```

## Project status

Version 3.2.0 is the current public release. The project focuses on creative single-player beatmap editing, arrangement and previewing. Multiplayer and automatic difficulty calculation are outside the current scope.

Not yet implemented, and next in line:

- Multi-difficulty editing of maps that share audio is possible today, but has not been exercised hard.

## Further plans

These ideas are exploratory and are not guaranteed for a specific release.

- Add rotation controls to transformations that do not support rotation yet
- Improve the usability of the Equation transformation
- Experiment with additional SV and visual gimmick concepts
- Improve the overall UI design
- Explore a possible web version
- Explore a possible full-alt transformation
- Consider adding an updater in a later version
- Thai localization ภาษาไทย
