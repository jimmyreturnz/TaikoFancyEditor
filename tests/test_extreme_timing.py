"""Maps whose timing points sit far outside anything a human plays.

Gimmick maps carry BPM values in the millions and, at the other end, sections
so slow that one beat is longer than the song. Both reach the snap grid as a
`beat_length`, and both used to break it *inside* paintEvent -- where Qt
swallows the exception, leaves the frame half-drawn and makes the map look like
it vanished rather than like it crashed.

`_draw_snap_grid` is called directly here for that reason: `view.grab()` cannot
fail these tests, because the exception never reaches the caller.
