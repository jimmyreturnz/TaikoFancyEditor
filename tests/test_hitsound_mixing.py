"""Where a note sample actually lands in the output.

The old path fired a `QSoundEffect` when the interpolated playhead crossed a
note. Nothing about that could be tested for placement -- the quantisation was
a rendered frame and the latency was the sound card's -- so what was tested
instead was which notes a *window* crossed, and the sound's position was taken
on faith. Mixed into the stream, placement is an integer and these assert it.

The invariant that matters is not "the note is at the millisecond it asks for"
but **"the note is on the same output sample as the music it belongs to"**. At a
slow rate those are different claims: the reported position is a linear map over
content that arrives a grain at a time, so a note placed by reported time drifts
against the music by `grain_offset_ms`'s residual, while one placed by source
frame cannot. `MusicAlignmentTests` is that invariant, and it is the reason this
file exists.
