"""MainWindow must let go of QApplication when it closes.

`__init__` makes two registrations on the *application*, which outlives every
window: an event filter and a `focusChanged` slot. Qt dispatches every
application event through every installed filter, so a second live
registration doubles the per-event Python work and an N'th multiplies it by N.

One window per run never noticed. The suite builds one per test and noticed
badly -- building twelve in a row went 171ms -> 976ms (5.7x) and the whole run
degraded past four hours. Releasing on close made that flat (164ms -> 154ms)
*with the same number of objects still alive*, which is what proves the cost
was the fan-out rather than the memory.

These tests guard the release itself rather than the timing: a wall-clock
assertion would be flaky on a loaded machine, while "is it still registered"
is exact.
