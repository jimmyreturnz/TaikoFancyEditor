"""Tap along to a click track to find this machine's audio offset.

**This writes one value: `audio/output_offset_ms`, the app's global music
offset.** It never reads or writes a beatmap's own offset, and never touches a
loaded document -- the number it produces is a property of the sound card and
drivers in this machine, not of anybody's chart, and mixing the two is the bug
class that made rate-dependent offsets so hard to pin down in the first place.
osu! and Quaver both keep the two apart for the same reason; Quaver states it
outright in issue #1204.

The click track is generated and played through `TrackPlayer`, deliberately --
that is the same decode-and-sink path the music takes, so what gets measured is
the latency the music actually has. Playing the clicks through `QSoundEffect`
would have been less code and would have measured the *hitsound* path, which
has its own latency and its own separate setting.

What the measurement includes, and cannot separate: the time between the sample
leaving `QAudioSink` and reaching the ear, plus however long the tap takes to
come back through the keyboard and Qt's event loop. That is the same round trip
every rhythm game's calibration measures.
