"""The music transport: decode to PCM ourselves, and drive the output device.

Replaces `QMediaPlayer` for song playback. The reason is not preference, it is
that everything making osu!'s editor accurate lives below the level Qt's player
exposes, and none of it can be reached from up there:

- **The clock is a sample cursor.** `TrackBass.updateCurrentTime` asks BASS for
  a byte position and converts it. `QAudioSink.processedUSecs()` is the same
  thing -- measured, not assumed: writing into a 250ms sink buffer keeps the
  written cursor exactly 250ms ahead of `processedUSecs`, so what it reports is
  audio actually played out, not audio handed over. `QMediaPlayer.position()`
  is a signal in whole milliseconds arriving whenever the backend feels like it.
- **Slowing down preserves pitch.** osu!'s editor slows down with
  `AdjustableProperty.Tempo` (BASS_FX time-stretch) at exactly the rates this
  app offers -- 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 -- not with a frequency change. Qt's
  `setPlaybackRate` is a plain resample: measured on the FFmpeg backend, a
  0.25x request delivers 0.261s of source per second of wall clock, which is a
  turntable slowed down, pitch and all. So the stretch is ours to do, and
  `TimeStretcher` below is the WSOLA that does it.
- **A rate change is a live attribute, not a restart.** osu! sets a tempo value
  on a running stream. `QMediaPlayer.setPlaybackRate` stalls the backend:
  measured on Windows Media Foundation, 114ms of song time vanishes across a
  0.25x -> 1.0x switch and 67ms at 1.0x -> 0.75x. Here the rate is a number the
  stretcher reads on its next grain, so there is nothing to stall.
- **Output latency is ours to choose.** The sink's buffer is 250ms by default
  and settable; `QMediaPlayer` never exposed it.

It also removes the Ogg problem outright. `QAudioDecoder` decodes through Qt's
FFmpeg decoder whatever the platform backend is, so there is no format the app
must fall back for, and no deprecated Windows backend to depend on.

The engine runs on its own thread. The stretch costs about 15% of a core at
0.25x (`tools/measure_stretch_quality.py`) -- affordable, but nowhere near
affordable on the thread that has 8.33ms to paint a frame in.

Four clocks, and which one is in charge
---------------------------------------

Most of the timing bugs this file has had were two of these being treated as
one, so they are named here.

1. **Chart time** -- the milliseconds in the `.osu`: note times, timing points,
   SV points, everything the editor draws and writes. Integers as the file
   gives them, and **nothing here ever changes one**. `frame_for_ms` is the
   only conversion out of it.

2. **Source time** -- the position in the decoded PCM, in frames. The same
   thing as chart time to within the audio's own offset, and the one the notes
   are placed against (`HitsoundMixer.mix`), because it is the only clock that
   says where a *sample of music* is rather than where the playhead thinks it
   is. Integer frames throughout.

3. **Device output time** -- when a sample reaches the ear. Sink buffer
   (`SINK_BUFFER_MS`, 80ms), driver, hardware, and on Bluetooth a great deal
   more. **Not knowable from in here**, only measurable: `offset_calibration`
   asks the user to tap along and writes `audio/output_offset_ms`, and gui.py
   subtracts it from what it draws.

4. **UI time** -- what the views are drawn against. gui.py's port of osu!'s
   `InterpolatingFramedClock` advances this once per rendered frame and eases
   it toward clock 2, so a frame arriving late does not make the playhead jump.

**Clock 2 is authoritative.** `_position_ms` reads `QAudioSink.processedUSecs`
-- the play cursor, measured, not the write cursor -- and maps it back through
`_segments` and `grain_offset_ms`. Clock 4 follows it and never leads it; clock
3 is a constant the user calibrates; clock 1 is data.

The one thing that is *not* derived from clock 4 any more is sound. Notes used
to be fired from the render loop, which made them a function of when a frame
happened to run; they are mixed against clock 2 now, so a dropped frame cannot
move a hitsound.

#
# SEQUENCE is how much output one grain contributes and OVERLAP is how much of
# that is cross-faded with the previous grain. **SEQUENCE must be much larger
# than OVERLAP.** The first version of this had them equal, which meant every
# output sample was a blend of two different parts of the song -- comb
# filtering from end to end, measured at 0.015 tonality (a 440Hz sine came out
# with 1.5% of its energy still at 440Hz). SoundTouch, which is what BASS_FX
# runs and therefore what osu! sounds like, uses an 82ms sequence against an
# 8ms overlap, so roughly 90% of its output is untouched source.
#
# These are tuned by `tools/measure_stretch_quality.py` *and* by ear, and it
# takes both: the harness is the only thing that catches a rate nobody listened
# to, and the ear is the only thing that caught the harness scoring a broken
# grain 0.987 because every signal it owns is synthetic.
#
# SEARCH is how far the read head may slide to find a splice that lines up with
# what was already written -- the whole difference between time-stretching and
# chopping. The intuition that it must span a period of the lowest frequency
# that matters (20ms for 50Hz) is wrong, and measurably so: what the
# correlation has to align is one *overlap* of continuation, so the reach is
# bounded by the grain rather than by the bass. See the table below.
# **Neither size is upstream's any more, and that is deliberate.** SoundTouch's
# companion line asks for a 125ms sequence at 0.25x, and shipping it made slow
# playback audibly worse than the 82ms it replaced: on a real mastered track at
# 0.25x a kick drum came apart, which two harnesses full of synthetic signals
# had rated 0.987 tonality and called fine. A ladder of grain lengths played
# through the real device at 0.25x -- 53, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5ms, A-B-A-B against
# 117ms to rule out a cold device -- put the knee at 20ms, and every number
# agrees with the ear once the overlap is allowed to scale with the grain:
#
#     grain   overlap   _fill p99/max   over 10ms budget   worst err @0.25x
#     117ms     8.0ms      20 / 47ms        70 / 750             45.1ms
#      53ms     6.6ms      20 / 30ms       132 / 673             21.0ms
#      30ms     3.8ms      11 / 20ms        11 / 692             11.3ms
#      20ms     2.5ms       7 / 19ms         1 / 793              7.5ms
#      10ms     1.3ms       6 / 22ms         1 / 691              3.8ms
#
# Two things in that table are the whole reason upstream's curve is wrong here:
#
# - **A shorter grain is cheaper, not dearer.** The search correlates over the
#   *overlap*, so scaling the overlap with the sequence shrinks the inner loop
#   as well as the hop. Held at SoundTouch's fixed 8ms it does not, and then a
#   short grain really is dearer -- which is what an earlier round of this
#   measured (0.18x realtime at 117ms against 0.57x at 40ms) and drew exactly
#   the wrong conclusion from.
# - **A fixed 8ms overlap is most of a short grain.** At 10ms it is 80% of the
#   output cross-faded, which is the comb filtering this docstring opens with
#   -- measured at 0.699 tonality, a third of a 440Hz sine leaving its own
#   frequency. Below about 30ms the overlap has to come down with the grain, or
#   the grain gets blamed for the window's failure.
#
# So one length at every rate, and the eighth of it that upstream's own 8ms is
# of its 82ms nominal. There is nothing left for the rate to change: this is
# already shorter than the shortest sequence `calcSeqParameters` ever asks for.
#
# **And then SEARCH has to come down with it, which is the half that is easy to
# miss.** Upstream's 25ms reach was sized against upstream's 117ms grain -- a
# ratio of 0.21. Left at 25ms against a 20ms grain it is *wider than the whole
# grain*, and wider than the read head's own hop (`sequence * rate`: 5ms at
# 0.25x, 15ms at 0.75x), so a grain may be taken from source the previous grain
# has already emitted. That is not a subtle effect. Sweeping the rule at a
# fixed 20ms sequence, tonality (how much of a 440Hz sine is still at 440Hz;
# the source scores 1.000) and warble (the source's own floor is 0.150):
#
#     reach rule          0.25x           0.5x            0.75x          cpu
#     soundtouch 25ms     0.923 / 0.168   1.000 / 0.159   0.457 / 0.154  0.38x

# rate where upstream's reach is still nearly its full width against the short
# grain, and it is the one that collapsed -- which no amount of listening at
# 0.25x would have found.
#
# It does give up reach in absolute terms: 10ms spans a 100Hz period rather
# than the 50Hz the 20ms above was chosen for. Measured, that costs nothing,
# because what the correlation has to align is one overlap of continuation

#
# - Uncorrected physical device latency (`audio/output_offset_ms` at its
#   default of 0). Wrong direction: a constant *wall-clock* delay maps to
#   `L * rate` of *song-time* mismatch, which shrinks at slower rates -- the
#   opposite of "worse at 0.25x, decent at 1.0x".
# - `gui.py`'s interpolating clock (`_advance_interpolated_clock`) introducing
#   its own lag on top of this. Simulated exactly (constants and formula
#   copied verbatim) and driven first by a perfect ramp, then by the real,
#   grain-quantised reports above: the displayed clock tracks the engine's own
#   reported position to within simulation noise at every rate. It extrapolates
#   by the known rate every frame and only blends the *residual*, which has
#   zero steady-state lag against a signal advancing at a roughly constant
#   rate -- unlike a plain low-pass filter, which would not.
#
# The measured points do not sit on one straight line in `(1 - rate)`, so this

# does not actually lie on -- which would claim a precision the measurement

        `_voiced_through` is an absolute source frame, but it only means

        **The music level is applied here too**, which is not where it used to
        be. `QAudioSink.setVolume` attenuates everything written to it, so with
        the notes in the same buffer it scaled them as well -- and, worse, it
        happens *after* the sum, so it cannot make room for anything. Measured
        on a 0dBFS master with the default 65% music and 70% hitsounds, moving
        the attenuation to here takes saturated samples from 71 per note to
        9.6: the music has to be turned down before the notes are added, or the
        addition is the thing that clips. It also gives the two volume sliders
        back their independence, which they had when hitsounds left through
        `QSoundEffect` and briefly lost when they did not.

        The cost is that a volume change is heard a grain plus the sink buffer
        later (about 100ms) rather than instantly. Nobody can hear the
        difference on a slider drag, and the alternative is clipping.

        **The watermark is the dedupe, and it is not an optimisation.** At rate
        < 1 the read head advances `sequence * rate` while each grain covers
        `sequence`, so consecutive grains overlap in source and a note's frame
        falls inside roughly 1/rate of them -- four grains at 0.25x. Voicing it
