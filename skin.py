"""Load the note graphics out of an osu! skin folder.

**Only the playfield.** A skin folder holds well over a hundred files --
judgement counters, the song-select menu, mode icons, the scoreboard, cursor
art -- and none of that appears in a preview that never judges a hit or shows a
score. What is loaded is the wiki's *playfield* list and nothing else:

    taikohitcircle          the note body, a white disc tinted per note
    taikohitcircleoverlay   the ring drawn over it, never tinted
    taikobigcircle          the same for a finisher
    taikobigcircleoverlay
    approachcircle          the hit-target ring, 126x126 to the note's 118x118
    taiko-roll-middle       a 1px-wide strip stretched along a drumroll body
    taiko-roll-end          the drumroll's tail cap, tinted like the body
    taiko-slider            776x162, the background that scrolls behind the bar
    taiko-bar-right         1024x200, the bar itself, stretched to the width
    taiko-bar-right-glow    the same rect again, laid over it during kiai
    taiko-barline           4x175, the measure marker

Left out on purpose, though the wiki files them under the playfield:

* the hit explosions (`taiko-hit300` and friends) and `taiko-slider-fail`: a
  judgement is a thing that happens to a *player*, and nobody is playing this.
  Drawing a 300 burst at the target would be inventing an autoplay run the
  preview is not;

* the input drum (`taiko-bar-left`, `taiko-drum-inner`, `taiko-drum-outer`) is
  where the player hits, not where the notes are, and nobody is hitting a
  preview;
* `taiko-glow` and `lighting` are the kiai glow *behind the hit position* --
  a bloom around a spot where nothing is being judged. Kiai is shown by the
  notes themselves pulsing and by `taiko-bar-right-glow` over the lane, which
  is information; a particle at the hit target is decoration on a marker;
* the mascot (`pippidon*`) is a character animation, in 6 of 39 installed
  skins, and the only element here that would need BPM-synced frames.

The tinting split is osu!'s own and is why the base files are plain white: the
base carries the note's colour (red for don, blue for kat, yellow for a
drumroll) and the overlay carries the outline that must stay the colour the
skinner drew it. Loading them the other way round produces a red ring on a
white note.

`@2x` variants are preferred wherever present -- they are the same artwork at
twice the resolution, and the preview scales everything to the lane height
anyway, so the larger source is free quality.

Anything missing falls back per element rather than per skin: a skin that ships
notes but no drumroll art gets its notes, and the built-in drawing for the
rest.
