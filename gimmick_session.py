"""Gimmick editor session state and the structures its tools write.

Three things live here, all of them free of Qt so they can be tested directly:

* the **pairing index** -- which difficulty a gimmick session edits, remembered
  permanently in `gimmick_index.json` beside the song library's `song_index.json`
* the **base timing snapshot** -- a copy of the document's timing taken when the
  session is created
* the **structure builders** -- the exact timing points and hit objects each
  gimmick tool emits

Why a base timing snapshot exists
---------------------------------
A gimmick fills the file with 60000 BPM lines. Every one of those restarts
measure counting and collapses the snap grid, so a chart view that derived its
grid from the document being edited would redraw itself under the user's cursor
on every placement. The snapshot is taken once, before any of that, and drives
snaps, wheel scroll and the BPM overlay for the life of the pairing. It is never
recomputed from the edited file.

The output file *is* expected to end up with shifted barline phase. Placements
deliberately write no phase-restoring lines: the snapshot keeps the editor
smooth, not the map.

SV is likewise not auto-restored. An uninherited point resets SV to 1.0x
(`osu_io.timing.sv_at`), so every structure here silently drops the green-line SV
in force at its time. Putting a green line back is the SV layers' job, and they
place it on the same millisecond as the red line by design. When they do,
**the green line must be ordered after the red one**: osu! resolves a shared
timestamp by file order, and `sorted_by_time` is a stable sort on time alone.

# 1:52.5-2:15.7 is the reference these four numbers were measured off.

# Wall ticks per beat. 36 over a 750ms beat is one red line every 20.8ms.

# its BPM, which is why it and the wall's own BPM below are both dials rather
# than derived: the reference section gets there with 72 lines a beat and a
# wall BPM of a third of the chart's, but that is one route to a white lane
# and not the only one.
DEFAULT_ANTI_LINES_PER_BEAT = 36
# Wall ticks omitted per note. The slit width is the note's colour: measured

# itself is invisible. The defaults are the owner's narrower 1 and 2, which
# keep the same 1:2 ratio; the reference's widths are one setting away.
DEFAULT_ANTI_DON_TICKS = 1

# sharing a note's millisecond would be a second uninherited point there, and

#
# `mew`'s `LuzeriA - Nbt-Hwt [The Pharaoh's Curse]` 1:56.9-2:07.3 is the
# reference, and it is anti-barline built the other way round. There the wall
# is a red line per tick and the slit is ticks left out; here **one** meter-1
# red line makes osu! emit the whole wall itself, and the slit is opened by
# raising SV for a fraction of a beat after the note.
#
# The reason that works is that taiko does not integrate velocity: an object
# sits at `(its time - now) x the velocity at its own time`. So the bars drawn
# during the raised-SV window are pushed *ahead* of the ones at the base speed
# by `(excess velocity) x (how far away they still are)` -- a gap that opens as
# the section approaches from a distance and closes to nothing at the hit
# position. That is the "hidden": the colour is only readable early.
#
# Measured on the reference at SliderMultiplier 1.2: base 0.01x puts the bars
# 1.68px apart (solid under the sprite), don's +1.01% opens 3.5px per second of
# lead time and kat's +3.09% opens 10.7px -- exactly the 1:3 ratio the classic

    Three structures share this builder, because everything about the drawn
    object -- its shape, its offsets, which kind gets the finisher bit -- is
    identical between them, and only the timing points that shape it differ.
    Which one is built is read off `kind` and `shiny`:

    * **plain fake slider** (`kind="regular"`, not shiny) -- no note, so
      nothing to hide. One red line, on the slider itself, `fake_slider_offset_ms`
      after the snap and retimed by `fake_slider_bpm_multiplier`. There is no
      squash: a squash exists to hide a hittable note, and this structure does
      not have one.
    * **shiny** (`shiny=True`) -- a glow around a note that *stays visible*, so
      squashing it is not an option: that would delete the very note the glow
      decorates. Its red line sits on the snap itself, retimed by
      `shiny_bpm_multiplier`, and that is the whole structure: no green line.
      Written only when `shiny_red_line` is on -- see that field for what
      dropping it costs. `shiny_count` sliders, the stack that reads as
      white, sit `shiny_offset_ms` later, beside the note rather than on it.
      With a Don/Kat `kind` a real, hittable note is written on the snap as
      well, undisturbed by any of this.
    * **Don / Kat, not shiny** -- the one case that deliberately hides its
      note. A gimmick-BPM line squashes the snap to nothing; an SV line on top
      of it (`fake_slider_sv`) -- the uninherited point has just reset SV to
      1.0x, so this is a green line stacked after the red one -- takes the
      already-squashed note the rest of the way off screen; and the chart's
      own BPM comes back `fake_slider_offset_ms` later (retimed by
      `fake_slider_bpm_multiplier`), which is exactly where the fake slider --
      small for Don, big (finisher bit) for Kat -- is the only thing left to
      look at.

    **No structure here carries the chart's own SV.** The only green line left
    is the Don/Kat `fake_slider_sv`, which is the gimmick's own number and
    exists to finish taking an already-squashed note off screen -- so it is
    written only when `hide_note` is on, and dropped with the squash when it is
    off. A fake slider is decoration: inheriting the speed of whichever section
    it was dropped in made identical structures scroll differently.

    Wherever there is a green line, it is always written *after* the red line
    sharing its millisecond: osu! resolves a shared timestamp by file order,
    and an uninherited point resets SV to 1.0x, so the other way round would
    silently cancel it.

    `big` is Shift-placement, exactly the finisher bit a Shift-clicked Don or
    Kat gets in a normal chart -- here it makes the drawn object the big one.
    Only `kind="regular"` (the plain fake slider and the shiny both) honours
    it: a Don or Kat already spends that bit saying which of the two it is
    (see `_SLIDER_HITSOUND`), so its size is not free to mean anything else.

    `copies` overrides the slider count for one call; otherwise it is
    `shiny_count` for a shiny and 1 otherwise. The note, where there is one, is
    what the player hits; the fake slider is the decoration next to it, which
    is why it cannot share the note's millisecond -- two hit objects on one
    timestamp leaves one of them permanently invisible.

    None of this takes the red-line placement offset -- that belongs to the
    plain red-line tool alone.

    A barline note draws bars *around* a note. This packs the lane with bars
    until it reads as one white sheet and takes bars *away* where each note is,
    so every note is a black slit travelling in the sheet -- the exact inverse
    of a barline. `mekurume [eclosion]` 1:52.5-2:15.7 is the reference.

    Two structures, and they only work together:

    * **The wall.** One uninherited point every `beat / anti_lines_per_beat`,
      each carrying `anti_wall_bpm` -- or the chart's own where that is None.
      A BPM below the chart's is what packs the bars tighter than their
      millisecond spacing alone would: an uninherited point's BPM is its scroll
      speed, so a third of it draws the same lines a third as far apart. It
      also has to keep `beat_length x meter` longer than the tick spacing, or
      a wall line emits a *second* barline before the next one arrives -- which
      the chart's own BPM and anything slower does with room to spare.
    * **The notes.** Per note, a squash line on its own millisecond and a
      restore one after it. The squash makes the note scroll 392px/ms, which is
      to say invisible; the restore hands the chart's BPM back with a meter
      long enough that it never emits a bar of its own. **Both carry
      omit-first-barline**, and that is the whole subtlety -- each is a red
      line, and without the flag each would stamp a bar in the middle of the
      slit it exists to open. With `hide_note` off there is no squash and so
      nothing to restore: one line, the chart's own BPM, same flag and same
      meter, and the note travels through its own slit in plain sight.

    The slit itself is the wall ticks nearest the note, left out. Its width is
    the note's *colour* (`anti_don_ticks` / `anti_kat_ticks`), because the note
    is invisible and there is nothing else to read one off. Centred on the
    note, since the note's own two lines sit in the middle of the hole.

    Only plain circles are converted. A finisher, a drumroll and a spinner are
    all left exactly as they are: a finisher is marked some other way (the
    reference section uses a fake slider on the six downbeats), and a body that
    lasts longer than a slit has nothing to be a slit of.

    The classic converter writes a red line per bar and takes bars away. This
    writes **one** meter-1 red line and lets osu! emit every bar of the wall
    from it, then opens each note's slit by raising SV for a fraction of a beat
    after the note -- see the constants above for why a velocity change is a
    gap. Four lines per note against the other one's hundreds, and the slit
    grows with distance instead of being a fixed number of pixels.

    Per plain circle at `T`:

        T,   hide BPM,  meter 999, omit-first-barline   # the note, gone

    bar of their own; the hide line carries omit-first-barline for that reason

    resumed sheet.

    Only plain circles are converted, the same rule and for the same reasons as
    `anti_barline`: a finisher is marked some other way and a body outlasting
    its own slit has nothing to be a slit of.
